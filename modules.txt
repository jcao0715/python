module - contains python definitions and statements

fibo.py:

def fib(n):
	a, b = 0, 1
	while a < n:
		print(a, end = ' ')
		a, b = b, a + b
	print()

def fib2(n):
	result  = []
	a, b = 0, 1
	while a < n:
		result.append(a)
		a, b = b, a + b
	return result


>>> import fibo 
	- allows you to access functions in fibo
	>>> fibo.fib(10)
	fib = fibo.fib

>>> from fibo import fib, fib2
	- does same thing as >>> from fibo import *
	- using * is frowned upon, so beware
>>> fib(500)

>>> import fibo as fib
	- renames fibo to fib

>>> from fibo import fib as fibonacci
	- renames fib to fibonacci


if __name__  == "__main__":
	import sys
	fib(int(sys.arbv[1]))

- allows you to do:
>>> python fibo.py 10
... 0 1 1 2 3 5 8

>>> dir(fibo)
	 - returns names in which a module defines
